      <h2>Project</h2>
         <h3>Mitigating Privacy Risks from Inference Attacks</h3>
         <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Developed an anomaly detection system using the Django web framework and machine learning to identify potential 
inference attacks from network traffic and database access logs, enhancing database security and privacy protection. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed the system to learn normal user and database access patterns, enabling real-time identification of suspicious 
or abnormal activities that could indicate inference-based intrusions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented an ensemble learning approach using VotingClassifier, integrating multiple models to improve detection 
accuracy and robustness, while leveraging Django’s secure, scalable architecture for practical deployment. 
                </li>
            </ul>
