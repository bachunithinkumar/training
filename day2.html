<b>Friendship</b> is one of the most beautiful relationships in life. A true friend is someone who understands us, supports us, and stands by us in both good and bad times. 
<br><i><strong>Friends make our lives happier by sharing laughter, secrets, and memories.</strong></i></br>They help us grow, inspire us to do better, and never let us feel alone. 
<u>True friendship is based on trust, honesty, and love</u>. Without friends, life would feel dull and incomplete, but with them, every moment becomes special and full of joy.
